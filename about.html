          <h1>Michael's Story</h1>
          <p>
            Designer Michael Kors was raised in Merrick, Long Island, a suburban
            town 23 miles from New York City. His keen eye for fashion was
            evident at a young age: at five, he advised his mother, Joan, to cut
            the bows off her wedding dress for her second marriage. She removed
            the bows.
          </p>
        </div>
      </div>
      <div class="info-card reversed">
        <p>
          Kors graduated from high school in 1977 and attended the Fashion
          Institute of Technology in New York City. He also took a job at
          Lothar’s, a trendsetting boutique on West 57th Street, where his
          talents were noticed by Dawn Mello, then executive vice president of
          Bergdorf Goodman. Mello encouraged Kors to contact her if he ever
          designed a collection. Kors did just that, and in 1981 officially
          launched his own line. He held his first runway show in 1984, sending
          Iman down the runway in a turtleneck and gray flannels.
        </p>
        <img
          src="https://digital.michaelkors.com/michaels-world/about-us/EU/desktop/ABOUT_US_4.jpg"

      </div>
      <div class="info-card">

          src="https://digital.michaelkors.com/michaels-world/about-us/EU/desktop/ABOUT_US_5.jpg"
          alt=""
        />
        <p>
          Kors was successful from the start, designing chic, luxurious
          sportswear that was both glamorous and effortless. He built a
          reputation as a designer who understands how women live and how they
          want feel in their clothes—confident, at ease, indulged and in
          control. By combining pragmatism with an unerring sense of chic, Kors’
          unique take on “all American sportswear” would eventually go global.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="info-card reversed">
        <p>
          “People think of sportswear as uniquely American, but women around the
          world love playing with separates because they can put their own spin
          on them,” Kors has said. “The creative thinking behind sportswear is
          the same no matter where you are—it’s all about great pieces that
          women can wear every day.”
        </p>
        <img

        />
        <p>
          From 1997 to 2004, as he continued to build his own business, Michael
          Kors also served as creative director of Céline, the renowned French
          luxury brand. The appointment was notable—few American designers had
          headed up French brands—and his impact was significant. Kors is widely
          credited with restoring the brand’s luster, reestablishing it as a
          major European fashion house. During that same period, he launched
          Michael Kors Mens (2002) and MICHAEL Michael Kors (2004).
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="info-card reversed">
        <p>
          Despite the demands of running a global fashion house, Kors has always
          focused on giving back. For over 25 years he has been a passionate
          supporter of God’s Love We Deliver, a non-profit organization that
          cooks and delivers nutritious meals to people living with serious
          illnesses in and around New York City. In 2013 Michael Kors launched
          “Watch Hunger Stop,” partnering with the United Nations World Food
          Programme (WFP) to help fight world hunger. To date, Michael Kors has
          helped WFP deliver over 17 million meals to hungry children. In 2015
          the designer was named Global Ambassador Against Hunger for the United
          Nations World Food Programme.
